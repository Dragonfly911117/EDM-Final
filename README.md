# EDM Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for EDM(Educational Data Mining, ~~not Electronic Dance Music~~) course.

## Data-preprocessing

The data is
from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/alcohol-effects-on-study?select=Portuguese.csv).  
We use the Portuguese data in this project.

## Data preprocessing
### Data cleaning
Then we use [data_preprocess.py](models/data_preprocess.py) to handle non-numerical data.  
We define those students who get sum of G1, G2, G3 less than 36 as "fail" and others as "pass".


### PCA(optional)

We then follow [tutorial](https://leemeng.tw/essence-of-principal-component-analysis.html) to lower the dimension of data to 5.

PCA variance ratio =  [0.52424711 0.07050346 0.06545911 0.05062572 0.03483436]
